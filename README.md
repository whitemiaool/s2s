## Introduction
this repo can help you tanslate js syntax to what you want.Sometimes we have to consider browser compatibility issues, fuck it! we need to be compatible with more platforms when we need to publish our NPM package. This tool helps you to compile your code based on your babel profile. Enjoy it
## How to use
```
npm i s2s -g
```
Before using, you need to create a .babelrc file, otherwise the tool will go wrong.Then just like we use 'node bababa',current you can use only one command,as follow:
```
s2s c [option]
```
option is you will copmile js file,of course,this tool only compile js file,other types of files will be copied intact to the dist folder directly
